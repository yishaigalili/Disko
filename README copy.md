### Migrate Images in Kubernetes

This feature helps to move a cluster to a chosen registry. It does this by copying current images to the target registry and using these copies to run new pods. The migration process is happening by upgrading the helm chart with the new image.

- Click on Migrate Clusters button
- A cluster migration window will pop
- Enter target registry, tag, username, password, helm chart path
- Click the Submit button
